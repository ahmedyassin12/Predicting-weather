🌤️ Weather Prediction App
This is a simple yet insightful Machine Learning web app built with Streamlit. It predicts the temperature for a given date using Linear Regression, 
based on historical weather data. The app also offers rich visualizations and statistics to explore the dataset.

🚀 Features
📅 Predict temperature for any future/past date

📈 Visualize historical temperature data

📊 Display dataset statistics

🔥 Correlation heatmap of numerical features

💡 Clear disclaimer about model limitations

🛠️ Tech Stack

Tool/Library | Purpose
Python       | Core programming language
Pandas       | Data manipulation
Scikit-learn | Machine learning (Linear Regression)
Streamlit    | Build the interactive web app
Seaborn      | Correlation heatmap visualization
Matplotlib   | Plotting figures

📦 Dataset
Source: weatherHistory.csv
Includes temperature data with timestamps and weather conditions

🧪 Running the Project
##1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-prediction-app.git
cd weather-prediction-app

##2. Install dependencies
Make sure you have Python installed, then run:
pip install -r requirements.txt

##3. Add the dataset
Make sure weatherHistory.csv is in the root directory of the project.

##4. Launch the app
streamlit run app.py

##5.Open in browser
Visit http://localhost:8501 to interact with the app.

📸 Preview
Here’s what the app does:

🔍 Input a date → get predicted temperature 🌡️

📈 View line chart of historical data

🧮 See basic statistics (mean, std, etc.)

🔥 Correlation heatmap of all numerical features

⚠️ Disclaimer
This app uses a very basic linear regression model that only considers time. In real-world weather forecasting, 
far more complex models and features (e.g. humidity, pressure, cloud coverage) are used.
